CLIP-Prompt-Lab is a research-oriented repository for exploring Zero-shot Image Classification using Multimodal CLIP models.

This project systematically investigates how Prompt Engineering affects model performance across two dimensions:

Structure: Comparing baseline, standard, descriptive, and Ensemble strategies on CIFAR-100.

Language: Analyzing cross-lingual robustness and semantic sensitivity between OpenAI CLIP and Chinese-CLIP on Caltech-101.
